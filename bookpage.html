    <div class="synopsis">
        <p>Life isn’t easy. Stories rarely have happy endings.</p>
        <p><span class="alien-voice">(What is this? a *reader?*…. )</span></p>
        <p>So you found me.…I mean, this book. Which means you were looking for something right? <span class="alien-voice">(Gross..a primate? And what are these things..hands? How primitive.)</span></p>
        <p>A troubled boy. A peculiar stone. Strange dreams that hint of worlds older than language.</p>
        <p>Continue to read this in your own voice my mortal worm. I mean.. <span class="alien-voice">*Friend.*</span></p>
        <p>Where were we? That’s right..Brother turns against brother. Giants stir in the abyss. Empires rise and fall as galaxies burn.</p>
        <p>In the middle of it: Sam, a young boy drifting through the crumbling orbit of his parents’ addictions, his childhood in the 90s was fractured from the start, everyday was a quiet drama. But when dreams become visitations, he realizes he’s not merely imagining these things, he’s living them.</p>
        <p><span class="alien-voice">(What’s that smell? Skin? Bones? Are you holding me with bones inside of you?!? Disgusting!)</span></p>
        <p>Mentors appear with half-truths, and gods who’ve been waiting longer than your kind has scurried on two legs tell of a threat that devours stars…drawing closer, its tendrils tasting worlds before swallowing them whole.</p>
        <p><span class="alien-voice">*(But you clearly weren’t looking for any of that right?)</span></p>
